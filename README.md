# Build-A-Bot 🛠️🤖  
### Where Life-Long AI Companions Are Made
![Build-A-Bot Banner](resources/Banner2.png)

**Build-A-Bot** is the first-ever **on-chain composable AI agent character platform**, enabling users to craft and fully own their AI agent companions. Inspired by the idea of customizing a teddy bear at a store, **Build-A-Bot** allows users to **assemble their dream AI agent** by selecting different tokenized AI **modules** (e.g., personality, knowledge bank, speech, tone) from an **open marketplace**.

This is powered by our **Module-as-a-Service (MaaS) system**, enabling AI researchers and enthusiasts to securely share and tokenize AI modules using **decentralized storage (Walrus) and Sui blockchain technology**. Our vision is to create a **vibrant economy for AI character content**, where users have complete ownership over the components that make up their AI agents.

## 🌟 Why Build-A-Bot?  
Most existing AI chatbots (like **Character.AI**) restrict users to **predefined, unchangeable personalities**. **Build-A-Bot breaks these limitations** by offering **full composability**—letting users pick and swap AI modules **like LEGO bricks** to build and customize their AI agents freely.  

Each **Build-A-Bot AI Agent** consists of five core **modular components**:

### 🧩 **AI Agent Modules**  
1. **Personality Module**  
   - Defines the character's **behavior, quirks, and speaking style**  
   - Example: A sassy pirate, a wise mentor, a caring assistant  

2. **Knowledge Bank Module**  
   - Adds **verifiable external knowledge** to the AI agent  
   - Example: Real-time **market data**, **textbooks**, **historical records**  
   - Eliminates hallucinations, ensuring factual accuracy  

3. **Speech Module**  
   - Controls **text-to-speech (TTS) parameters**  
   - Example: **Masculine/feminine voice**, speech speed  

4. **Tone Module**  
   - Applies a **voice filter** on top of the speech module  
   - Example: Make the AI agent **sound like a Japanese anime character or Donald Trump**  

5. **Memory Module (Soul of the AI Agent)**  
   - Stores **all past interactions** with the user  
   - Essential for making the AI **remember** user preferences, names, hobbies, etc.  

## 🚀 **How It Works**  
1. **Pick & Assemble Modules**: Users select **different modules** from the open marketplace to **create their AI agent**.  
2. **Live AI Composition**: Modules can be **swapped instantly**, e.g., **changing the agent's voice** or **adding a new knowledge module** (e.g., Quantum Physics textbook).  
3. **On-Chain Ownership**: Each module is **tokenized on the Sui blockchain**, ensuring **true ownership** and **persistent AI data storage** via **Walrus**.  
4. **Publish Your Own Modules**:  
   - Easily **upload pretrained AI model weights** through a **drag-and-drop interface**  
   - Module data is **stored on Walrus with a proof of data availability** inscribed on-chain  
   - Ownership of the **on-chain module object** guarantees access to the module forever  

## 🔗 **Why Sui and Walrus?**  
By leveraging **Sui blockchain** and **Walrus decentralized storage**, we ensure that:  
✔️ **AI Agents are Fully Owned** → Users **own their AI companions forever without needing to break the bank**  
✔️ **AI Modules are Tradeable** → Open marketplace for **AI components & characters**  
✔️ **Data Persistence** → AI agent data is **resistant to deletion/censorship**, users have full custody of their data  

## 🏆 **Hackathon Details**  
- **Built for:** Sui AI Agent Hackathon  
- **Development Time:** 1 week  
- **Core Technologies:**  
  - **Sui Blockchain** (Tokenization & AI Composition Coordination)  
  - **Walrus** (Decentralized Storage)  

## 🛠️ **Future Vision**  
- **Decentralized AI Marketplace**: AI researchers can **monetize** and share **AI modules** securely.  
- **AI NFTs**: Users can tokenize **fully customized AI companions** as **NFTs**.  
- **Cross-Chain Expansion**: Expanding beyond **Sui** to other blockchain networks.
